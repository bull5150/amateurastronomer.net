A Coding Site I made during the Corona.

This site is live at the below address:

Good examples of Twitter, GoogleMaps Apis, .net vs .netcore


This repo also contains two backends.  I originally built the .net 4.7(RestAPI) but later created a .netcore backend in .net 5.0(RestAPIcore) as well.  That is the backend that is actually used on the website.
